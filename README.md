As I am always coming up with new cornhole games to play, I saw a set of boards that had 3 holes. I was fascinated. So I got a custom set built. Then I borrowed game ideas for Golf, and Baseball, and football from TTC. Their app is not good at all. Many of his games did not have functionality inside their app. So I created my own. I also created  Basketball and Cricket. I've been using them since summer 2025.
